Grass clippings are placed in a bin, where they decompose. For the interval 0 to 30,
the amount of grass clippings remaining in the bin is modeled by A = 6.687(0.931)^t
where A(t) is measured in pounds and t is measured in days.
Part a is asking us, Find the average rate of change of A(t) over the interval 0 to 30. 
and Indicate units of measure.

now we can use the slope formula: y2 - y1 over x2 - x1
let's substitute in terms of A, and then substitute again with its actual equation
snap snap snap snap

finally we have -0.1968 as our final answer, and don't forget our units, pounds per day


part b is asking us, find the value of A'(15). Using correct units interpret the meaning of 
the value in the context of the problem

we already know that the derivative of a function is simply a tangent linear line along a function
for the purpose of this project, we can visualize it with a graph. 

we can see that the tangent line when x = 15 looks something like this, a decently steep linear line

let's take the derivative of the function with respect to t, since this is calculator active,
you are permitted to use a calculator, but i am too lazy to do so. so im going to calculate 
this by hand. we know that e and ln cancel each other out, so we can rewrite our expression like so 
according to the laws of logarithms, we can take the t out and multiply it with the natural log term

now when we use chain rule and multiply with ln(0.931)
now, since we're trying to find A'(15), we plug in 15 

This means that the total amount of grass clippings in the bin is decreasing at 
exactly -0.1635 pounds per day specifically on day 15 



part c is asking us Find the time t for which the amount of grass clippings in the bin is equal to the
average amount of grass clippings in the bin over the interval 0 to 30 

Recall that we are given A(t) = 6.687(0.931)^t as the total grass clippings
while the average amount of grass clippings can be represented with the average value formula
one over b minus a times the integral of A(t) with respect to t 

now let's plug in a and b respectively

let's set both expressions to each other

first let's evaluate the definite integral:
let's take the constant out
we already know that e to the power of ln of k cancels out to k or whatever term is inside the natural log
so we can rewrite the integral
taking the integral will get us this:

now we can use the properties of integrals to evaluate by plugging in 30 and 0  
ln(0.931) * 0 is 0 and e to the power of 0 is one 

we can then   out 6.687 over ln(0.931) as a common factor
let's rewrite so its looks prettier
 
we now know that the integral with a lower bound of 0 and a upper bound of 30 of A(t) is equal to 
6.687 over 30 * ln(0.931) times e to the power of 30 * ln(0.931) - 1

now to answer the question, let's set it equal to the standard equation

since 6.687 is a reciprocal on each side of the equation, they can cancel out

let's rewrite

now we can take the natural log on both sides
take the t down with the property of natural logarithms
divide both sides by the ln(0.931)
the left side cancels out
